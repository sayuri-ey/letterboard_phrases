'''
Code to verify the possibility of writing phrases with available characters set in a letterboard.
It asks the user for a phrase (input) and it checks whether it is possible to write the phrase, 
or if there are insufficient characters in the set to write the determined phrase
or if the user is using invalid charaters, which do not exist in the characters set.
